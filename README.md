# 🔹 SwitchLab Blog

Welcome to **SwitchLab Blog**, a personal developer site powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme.

This blog documents my journey as a backend developer passionate about cloud computing and mechanical keyboards.  
You'll find curated portfolio content, development logs, and technical notes that reflect growth, curiosity, and craftsmanship.

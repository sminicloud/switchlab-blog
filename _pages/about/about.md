## Hi, I'm Soonmin!

I'm a developer and mechanical keyboard enthusiast.  
I started my journey as a developer through a government-funded program in Korea, where I learned Java development. After gaining 3 years of experience as a full-stack developer, I moved to Australia to study IT Network Security. Currently, I am enrolled in the PY program and actively seeking job opportunities in the IT field.

My passion for development goes hand-in-hand with my love for mechanical keyboards, which I enjoy customizing and exploring. I aim to combine my skills in backend development with my enthusiasm for technology to create innovative solutions.
